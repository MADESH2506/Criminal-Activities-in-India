# Criminal-Activities-in-India
**Project Overview**
This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of India’s crime landscape over a decade. By utilizing Power BI, I transformed a massive dataset of over 5 Million records into an interactive intelligence dashboard. The goal is to move beyond simple crime counting to evaluate law enforcement performance, track fluctuating regional trends, and identify the "Loss Gap" in property recovery.

**Key Highlights**
> **Temporal Scope:** 10-Year Longitudinal Study (2015–2025).

> **Total Records Processed:** 5M+ incidents.

> **Recovery Efficiency:** Identified a 36.06% property recovery rate across 857K general crime cases.

**Technical Stack**
> **Tool:** Power BI Desktop

> **Data Cleaning:** Power Query (ETL)

> **Modeling:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for complex KPIs

> **Data Source:** Multi-state crime records (Excel/CSV)

**Key Features & Analysis**

**1. General Crime & Property Recovery**
  The Recovery Gap:
  > A deep dive into the ratio of stolen vs. recovered assets.

  > Trend Analysis: Tracking the 10-year evolution of crimes such as Theft, Burglary, Dacoity, Robbery, and Drug Offenses.

  > tate Hotspots: Geospatial mapping of high-density reporting states (e.g., Puducherry, Manipur).

**2. Crimes Against Women Analysis**
  > Social Impact: Focused study on Domestic Violence (~39% of cases), Rape, Kidnap and Assault, and Dowry Deaths.

  > Intervention Priority: Utilized Funnel Charts to rank crime types and identify areas requiring urgent policy intervention.

**3. Data Transformation (ETL)**
  > Removed Demographic Noise (Victim Age Groups) to focus strictly on operational trends.

  > Handled null values and standardized state-wise naming conventions.

  > Created custom DAX measures to fix summation errors in percentage calculations.
